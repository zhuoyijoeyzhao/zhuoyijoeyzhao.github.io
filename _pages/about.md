<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a master's student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northwestern University supervised by Prof. Igor Kadota. Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor degree at Beijing Jiaotong University supervised by Prof. Jiayi Zhang. My current research interest is to develop theories and models that capture the fundamental limits and trade-offs of next-generation communication networks and multi-agent systems.
